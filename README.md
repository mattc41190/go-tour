## A Tour of Go

## What is this?

This is a hand copied collection of the exercises included in the popular tutorial "A Tour of Go".

## Why make this?

Sometimes the best way to learn something is to copy it out line by line thinking about what the code is doing the whole way through.

## How do I run this?

- `git clone <this-repo>`
- `cd <lesson-dir>`
- `go run main.go`

## Note

- All programs should unless otherwise stated run without any runtime panics. If the example in "A Tour of Go" induces a panic on purpose this code will be available for reference in comments and code that does not panic will be compiled as part of the lesson.
